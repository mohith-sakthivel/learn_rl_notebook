# Learn RL Notebook

## Description
This repository contains some experiments to gain intuition on a few reinforcement learning algorithms

The notebook will help visualize how the agent learns and explores

You can also run tests to evaluate the effects of various hyper-parameters on the agent's performance

Check out the images folder for pre-generated graphs and visualizations

## Enviroments

#### Available Agents

    - Semi-Gradient n-step SARSA agent
    - Semi-Gradient n-step Expected SARSA agent
    - Semi-Gradient Q-Learning agent
